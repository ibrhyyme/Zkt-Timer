				"title": "Permutation of Last Layer",
				"desc": "PLL is the final stage of the CFOP method, where all last layer pieces are moved to their correct positions while the top face color remains solved. At this point, the cross, F2L, and OLL are complete — you just need to shuffle pieces into their home positions. The set includes 21 algorithms, each named after a letter: Aa, Ab, E, F, Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd, H, Ja, Jb, Na, Nb, Ra, Rb, T, Ua, Ub, V, Y, and Z. Many speedcubers choose to learn PLL before full OLL since it has fewer cases and provides an immediate, noticeable improvement in solve times.\n\nRecognition is one of the most important skills for fast PLL execution. Most cubers identify cases by looking for headlights (two stickers of the same color side by side on one face) and blocks (connected solved pairs). For example, the T perm has a 1x1x3 block on the front and headlights on the left, while the Y perm has no blocks at all. With practice, you can recognize any PLL case from just two faces in under a second.\n\nBefore and after executing a PLL algorithm, you will often need to perform AUF (Adjust U Face) — a simple U, U', or U2 turn to align the last layer with the rest of the cube. Efficient AUF prediction, where you determine the final adjustment during the algorithm itself, is a key skill that separates sub-15 solvers from faster cubers. The fastest PLL cases are typically the U perms and H perm, while the N perms and G perms tend to be the slowest due to their length and grip changes."
			},
			"oll": {
				"title": "Orientation of Last Layer",
				"desc": "OLL is the third stage of CFOP. The goal is to orient every piece on the last layer so the top face becomes one solid color — for example, making the entire yellow face if you solve white first. There are 57 distinct cases in total, and they are commonly grouped by how many edges are already oriented: cross cases (all 4 edges oriented, leaving only corners to fix), shape cases like L, T, P, and W (2 edges oriented), and dot cases (0 edges oriented). If you already know 2-Look OLL, about 9-10 of those 57 are covered.\n\nThe difficulty and speed of OLL cases vary significantly by group. Cross cases are generally the fastest because they tend to be short algorithms with good fingertricks. Shape cases (L, T, P, W) form the middle ground — they are recognizable by the distinctive patterns their oriented edges create. Dot cases, where no edges are oriented, tend to be the slowest and hardest to both recognize and execute, since the algorithms are typically longer and involve more grip changes.\n\nMany OLL algorithms are mirrors or inverses of each other, which greatly helps with memorization. A common learning strategy is to start with the cross cases (since you already get the cross from 2-Look OLL), then learn the shape cases grouped by type, and finally tackle the dot cases last. Some speedcubers choose to never learn certain rare dot cases and instead use 2-Look for those specific situations, since the time investment may not be worth the marginal gain."
			},
			"f2l": {
				"title": "First Two Layers",
				"desc": "F2L is the second stage of CFOP, where you pair a corner with its matching edge and insert them into the correct slot simultaneously. This is significantly faster than solving the cross, corners, and second layer edges as separate steps. There are 41 basic cases plus their mirrors, covering every possible configuration of a corner-edge pair relative to its target slot. Learning F2L intuitively before memorizing algorithms is strongly recommended — understanding why pieces move where they do makes it much easier to handle cases you have not drilled yet.\n\nLookahead is the single most important skill for F2L speed. While inserting one pair, you should already be tracking the pieces of your next pair so there is no pause between insertions. This is what separates sub-20 solvers from sub-15 and below. Minimizing cube rotations is equally critical: every full cube rotation costs time and disrupts your lookahead flow. Top solvers aim to complete most pairs using only R, U, and F moves without rotating the cube at all.\n\nThe algorithms provided here are speed-optimized solutions that prioritize fingertrick efficiency and low move count. However, many cubers find that their intuitive solutions are nearly as fast for common cases. The biggest gains from algorithmic F2L come in tricky cases — such as when the corner is twisted in the slot or when both pieces are stuck in the wrong slot. Focus your algorithm study on these difficult cases rather than trying to memorize all 41+ solutions at once."

			"2_look_pll": {
				"title": "2-Look PLL",
				"desc": "2-Look PLL is a beginner-friendly approach to the PLL step that breaks permutation into two manageable stages. In the first step, you permute the corners using algorithms like the A perm (Aa or Ab) for adjacent corner swaps and the E perm for diagonal corner swaps. In the second step, you permute the edges using the U perms (Ua and Ub) for 3-edge cycles, the H perm for swapping two opposite edge pairs, and the Z perm for swapping two adjacent edge pairs.\n\nWith only about 6 algorithms total, 2-Look PLL is far more approachable than the full 21-algorithm PLL set. It is the recommended starting point for anyone transitioning from the beginner method to CFOP. While it does add one extra look and algorithm execution compared to 1-Look PLL, the time difference is small — typically only 1-2 seconds — and the reduced learning burden lets you focus on improving other areas of your solve like F2L efficiency and lookahead.\n\nOnce you are comfortable with 2-Look PLL, the natural progression is to learn the remaining full PLL algorithms one or two at a time. Many cubers start by adding the T perm and J perms since they appear frequently and have easy fingertricks."
			},
			"2_look_oll": {
				"title": "2-Look OLL",
				"desc": "2-Look OLL is a simplified approach to OLL that breaks the orientation step into two stages. In the first step, you orient the edges to form a yellow cross on top — there are only 3 possible edge patterns (dot, L-shape, and line) plus the already-solved cross. In the second step, you orient the corners using algorithms like Sune, Anti-Sune, and their variations. This gives you roughly 9-10 algorithms to learn in total.\n\nThis approach is much easier to learn than the full 57-algorithm OLL set and is the recommended starting point for any cuber moving beyond the beginner method. The edge orientation step uses a single algorithm (F R U R' U' F') applied one or two times depending on the case, while the corner orientation step introduces Sune (R U R' U R U2 R') and its variants. Together, these cover every possible OLL situation.\n\nThe main trade-off compared to full OLL is speed — 2-Look OLL requires two algorithm executions and an extra recognition pause between them. However, the time difference is typically only 1-3 seconds per solve, which makes it an excellent investment for cubers averaging 30 seconds or more. Once your solves are consistently under 25 seconds, gradually replacing 2-Look cases with their single-algorithm full OLL equivalents is the natural next step."
			},
			"coll": {
				"title": "Corners of Last Layer",
				"desc": "COLL solves the corners of the last layer while preserving edge orientation, meaning it can only be applied when all four last layer edges are already oriented (you have a cross on top). There are 42 algorithms divided across 6 subsets based on the corner orientation pattern: S (Sune), AS (Anti-Sune), T, U, L, and H (also called Pi). Each subset corresponds to a different way the corner stickers can be arranged on the top face.\n\nThe main benefit of COLL is that it guarantees a PLL case with already-solved corners. This means you will only ever get edge-only PLLs: the U perms (Ua, Ub), H perm, Z perm, or a complete PLL skip. You have a 1/12 chance of skipping PLL entirely, and the remaining cases are among the fastest PLLs to execute. This effectively eliminates slow cases like the G perms, N perms, and other multi-swap PLLs from your solves.\n\nCOLL is also a natural stepping stone toward learning ZBLL. Every COLL case is a subset of ZBLL — once you know COLL, you already have 42 of the 493 ZBLL algorithms memorized. Many competitive cubers use COLL selectively, applying it only when they recognize a favorable OLL case that leads to a cross on top, and defaulting to standard OLL otherwise. This selective approach gives most of the benefit with a fraction of the learning effort."
			},
			"ollcp": {
				"title": "OLL + Corner Permutation",
				"desc": "OLLCP handles orientation of the last layer and corner permutation in a single step. Instead of just making the top face one color (like standard OLL), OLLCP also places the corners into their correct positions simultaneously. This means that after OLLCP, you are guaranteed an edge-only PLL — the same benefit as COLL, but applied to every OLL case, not just the ones with oriented edges.\n\nThe full OLLCP set contains approximately 331 algorithms, making it one of the largest algorithm sets in competitive cubing. Because of this massive size, most cubers do not learn the entire set. Instead, they selectively learn OLLCP algorithms for specific OLL cases where the payoff is highest — particularly OLL cases that frequently lead to slow G perms or N perms when solved with standard OLL. This selective approach lets you get meaningful time savings without committing to hundreds of algorithms.\n\nOLLCP is recommended only for advanced cubers who are already comfortable with full OLL and full PLL. It is primarily used in CFOP, but some Roux solvers also apply OLLCP concepts in specific situations. If you are considering learning OLLCP, a good starting strategy is to identify which 5-10 OLL cases give you the worst PLL outcomes and learn OLLCP alternatives for just those cases first."
			},
			"zbll": {
				"title": "Zborowski-Bruchem Last Layer",
				"desc": "ZBLL solves the entire last layer — both orientation and permutation of all corners and edges — in a single algorithm, provided that all four edges are already oriented. This makes it ideal for methods where edge orientation is handled earlier in the solve, such as ZZ (which orients all edges during the first step) or CFOP with ZBLS/VHLS. The full set contains 493 algorithms divided across 7 subsets: T, U, L, H, Pi, S, and AS — each named after the corner orientation pattern on top, mirroring the COLL subsets.\n\nLearning full ZBLL is one of the largest commitments a speedcuber can make. Most cubers who pursue it spend 1-2 years to fully memorize and drill all 493 cases. The payoff is significant: you effectively reduce the last layer to a single algorithm execution, saving 2-4 seconds per solve compared to OLL+PLL. Recognition speed is critical — you need to identify the exact case from 493 possibilities quickly, which requires extensive pattern recognition practice beyond just memorizing the algorithms.\n\nThe recommended learning order is to start with the T and U subsets (which have the most ergonomic algorithms), then move to L and H, and finish with Pi, S, and AS. Many competitive ZZ solvers learn ZBLL subsets gradually over months, using COLL+PLL as a fallback for unlearned cases. Even partial ZBLL knowledge provides measurable improvement, since each learned subset eliminates a class of two-step solves."
			},
			"wvls": {
				"title": "Winter Variation Last Slot",
				"desc": "WVLS, also known as Winter Variation (WV), is an advanced last-slot technique for CFOP and ZZ solvers. It applies in a very specific situation: the last F2L corner-edge pair must already be paired together and ready to insert, and the last layer edges must already be oriented (forming a cross on top). When these conditions are met, WVLS modifies the insertion of the final pair to simultaneously orient the last layer corners — effectively skipping OLL entirely and going straight to PLL.\n\nThere are 27 cases in total, making WVLS a relatively small algorithm set that provides a significant payoff. Since the prerequisite is a paired F2L pair with oriented edges, it naturally pairs well with ZZ (where edges are always oriented) and can also arise in CFOP solves when the OLL edges happen to be oriented during the last slot. The algorithms are generally short and fingertrick-friendly since they are based on modified R U insertions.\n\nThe main limitation of WVLS is that the pair must already be connected — if the corner and edge are separated, you need to pair them first, which may disrupt the edge orientation. For cubers who want to handle unpaired situations as well, the broader VLS (Vandenbergh Last Slot) set covers those cases but at a much higher algorithm count. WVLS is an excellent return-on-investment algorithm set for cubers looking to add conditional OLL skips to their solves."
			},
			"vhls": {
				"title": "Vandenbergh-Harris Last Slot",
				"desc": "VHLS solves the last F2L pair while simultaneously orienting all four last layer edges. It is specifically designed for cases where the F2L pair can be inserted in 3 moves or fewer, which keeps the total algorithm count to just 32 manageable cases. The key idea is that instead of simply inserting the pair normally, you adjust the insertion to also flip any misoriented edges on the last layer.\n\nAfter completing VHLS, the last layer is guaranteed to have all edges oriented (a cross on top). This means only cross-type OLL cases remain, which dramatically increases your chances of favorable outcomes. The probability of a complete OLL skip jumps from the standard 1/216 to 1/27, and even when you do not skip OLL, the remaining cross cases are among the fastest and most ergonomic OLL algorithms.\n\nVHLS pairs naturally with COLL: after VHLS gives you oriented edges, COLL can solve the corners while setting up for an edge-only PLL. This VHLS + COLL + EPLL pipeline is a popular intermediate approach for cubers who want better last-layer outcomes without committing to full ZBLL. The 3-move insertion limit keeps the set small and practical, though cubers seeking complete edge-orientation control during the last slot should look into the full ZBLS set."
			},
			"zbls": {
				"title": "Zborowski-Bruchem Last Slot",
				"desc": "ZBLS, also known as EOLS (Edge Orientation Last Slot), inserts the final F2L corner-edge pair while simultaneously orienting all last layer edges. It is the first half of the ZB method — after ZBLS ensures all edges are oriented, ZBLL can solve the entire last layer in a single algorithm. Together, ZBLS + ZBLL creates one of the most powerful two-step last layer approaches in speedcubing.\n\nWith approximately 302 algorithms, ZBLS is a significant learning investment. The cases cover every possible combination of last-slot pair position and last-layer edge orientation state. Unlike VHLS, which only handles pairs insertable in 3 moves or fewer, ZBLS covers all situations — including cases where the pair is split, misoriented, or partially stuck in the wrong slot. This completeness is what makes it so large but also so powerful.\n\nZBLS is primarily used by ZZ method solvers (where edge orientation on the first two layers is already handled, leaving only last layer edges) and by advanced CFOP solvers who want to transition to a ZB-based last layer. The recommended approach is to learn the most common cases first and gradually expand coverage. Many cubers use ZBLS selectively — applying it when they recognize a familiar case and falling back to normal F2L insertion + OLL for unlearned ones."

			"cmll": {
				"title": "Corners of Last Layer (Roux)",
				"desc": "CMLL is the third step of the Roux method. After building the two 1x2x3 blocks on the left and right sides, you solve all four last layer corners — both their orientation and permutation — in a single step. The key difference from COLL is that CMLL is free to disturb the M-slice (the middle layer), since the M-slice will be solved later during the Last Six Edges (L6E) step. This freedom allows CMLL algorithms to be shorter and more efficient than their COLL equivalents.\n\nThere are 42 algorithms divided across 8 subsets based on the corner orientation pattern: O (oriented), S (Sune), AS (Anti-Sune), T, U, L, H (also called Pi), and the solved case. Each subset groups cases by how the corner top-face stickers are arranged, making recognition systematic once you learn the patterns. The algorithms primarily use R, U, and F moves, keeping them fingertrick-friendly.\n\nCMLL is a core requirement for competitive Roux solving — there is no way to avoid it at higher levels. The 42 algorithms are very manageable compared to other advanced sets, and most Roux solvers learn full CMLL relatively early in their progression. For beginners just starting Roux, 2-Look CMLL provides a stepping stone, but transitioning to full CMLL should be a priority once you are comfortable with block building."

				"title": "2-Look CMLL",
				"desc": "2-Look CMLL is a simplified version of CMLL designed for beginner and intermediate Roux solvers. After building the two 1x2x3 blocks, you solve the last layer corners in two steps: first orient all four corners so the top-face color is on top, then permute them into their correct positions. This requires approximately 9 algorithms total — significantly fewer than the 42 needed for full CMLL.\n\nThe orientation step uses the same algorithms as 2-Look OLL corner orientation (Sune, Anti-Sune, and their variants), while the permutation step uses corner-swap algorithms similar to those found in PLL. If you already know 2-Look OLL from CFOP, you will find that many of these algorithms are familiar, making the transition to Roux smoother.\n\n2-Look CMLL is sufficient for getting started with Roux and can carry you to sub-30 or even sub-25 times with good block building. However, full CMLL should be learned once you are comfortable with the method, as the time saved per solve adds up quickly. The good news is that with only 42 total cases, full CMLL is one of the smaller advanced algorithm sets — most cubers can learn it in a few weeks of focused practice."
			},
			"oh_cmll": {
				"title": "One-Handed CMLL",
				"desc": "OH-CMLL covers the same 42 CMLL cases but uses different algorithms specifically optimized for one-handed (OH) solving. When solving with a single hand, many standard two-handed algorithms become awkward or impossible to execute smoothly, so OH-CMLL replaces them with alternatives that flow naturally with one-hand fingertricks. The algorithms generally avoid z and x rotations, which are difficult to perform with one hand, and favor R, U, and r moves that can be executed fluidly.\n\nOne-handed Roux is a popular event category, and CMLL is often the step where OH solvers gain or lose the most time. Since you only have one hand to work with, algorithm choice matters even more than in two-handed solving — a bad fingertrick sequence can cost several seconds. The algorithms in this set prioritize smooth, continuous finger movements without regrips or awkward hand positions.\n\nIf you already know standard CMLL, transitioning to OH-CMLL involves relearning some cases with new algorithms while keeping others that already work well one-handed. Many cubers find that about half of their two-handed CMLL algorithms transfer directly to OH, while the other half need replacements. Practice these new algorithms slowly at first, focusing on clean fingertricks, before pushing for speed."

The goal of this step is to orient all six edges so they can be solved using only M and U moves in subsequent steps. This is solved entirely with M and U moves.\n\nThere are 6 total cases for edge orientation. Four of them are called arrow cases because the oriented edges form an arrow-like pattern pointing in a direction, and the remaining two are non-arrow cases. Arrow cases are generally easier to recognize and solve, while non-arrow cases require an extra setup move. With only 6 cases, this step can be learned very quickly — most cubers memorize all cases within a single practice session.\n\nEdge orientation recognition becomes intuitive with practice. You learn to see which edges are 'good' (can be solved with M/U moves) and which are 'bad' (need to be flipped). Speed in this step comes from instant recognition rather than algorithm execution speed, since the solutions are very short. Mastering EO recognition is also the foundation for the more advanced EOLR technique."

				"title": "Edge Orientation + Left/Right",
				"desc": "EOLR is an advanced Roux technique that combines edge orientation (step 4a) with placing the UL and UR edges (step 4b) into a single step. Instead of first orienting all edges and then separately positioning UL/UR, EOLR handles both simultaneously. The goal is to orient all six remaining edges while also ensuring the UL and UR edges end up on the bottom layer, ready to be inserted with a simple M2 move.\n\nEOLR is largely intuitive rather than algorithmic, which is part of what makes it appealing. Once you understand how M and U moves affect edge orientation and position, you can plan both outcomes together. The technique builds directly on your EO recognition skills — instead of just seeing which edges need flipping, you also track where UL and UR are and choose your EO solution to place them favorably. This saves the separate step 4b entirely, reducing LSE to just two steps: EOLR and then the final M-slice edges.\n\nMastering EOLR is one of the key milestones for competitive Roux solvers. It typically saves 1-2 seconds per solve compared to solving EO and LR separately, and it makes the LSE phase feel much more fluid. The learning curve is moderate — it requires developing a new way of seeing the cube during LSE rather than memorizing hundreds of algorithms. Most cubers develop EOLR skill gradually through deliberate slow solves where they consciously plan both EO and LR outcomes before executing."

				"title": "2x2 Corners of Last Layer",
				"desc": "CLL is used to solve the last layer of a 2x2 cube in a single step, rather than the two-step approach used in beginner methods (orient then permute). It requires the first layer to be fully solved — all four bottom-layer corners must be correctly positioned and oriented before applying a CLL algorithm. There are 42 cases in total, covering every possible arrangement of the four top-layer corners.\n\nCLL is the standard intermediate algorithm set for 2x2 solvers. The method flow is straightforward: solve the first layer, then apply one CLL algorithm to solve everything else. Because the 2x2 has no edges or centers, CLL alone is sufficient to complete the entire cube once the first layer is done. The algorithms are generally short (8-12 moves) and most have excellent fingertricks.\n\nOnce you learn CLL, the natural next step is EG-1 and EG-2. The EG family extends the concept: instead of requiring a fully solved first layer, you only need one solved face (regardless of whether the bottom corners are permuted correctly). CLL covers the case where the first layer happens to be fully solved (1/6 probability), while EG-1 and EG-2 handle the remaining states. This progression lets you skip the time-consuming step of permuting first-layer corners entirely."

			"2x2_eg1": {

				"desc": "EG-1 is the algorithm set that handles the most common first-layer state in 2x2 solving: the adjacent swap. After solving one face (not a full layer — just getting all four stickers of one color on the bottom), the four bottom corners can be in one of three permutation states: fully solved (CLL), adjacent swap (EG-1), or diagonal swap (EG-2). The adjacent swap occurs with 4/6 probability, making EG-1 the most frequently used set in the EG family.\n\nThere are 29 EG-1 cases. Each algorithm simultaneously solves the adjacent corner swap on the bottom layer and all four top-layer corners in a single step. This is what makes EG so powerful — instead of first permuting the bottom corners (which costs extra moves and time) and then applying CLL, you solve everything at once after just building a face. The algorithms are slightly longer than CLL on average but the time saved by skipping first-layer permutation more than compensates.\n\nLearning EG-1 is the highest-impact upgrade after CLL because of its high probability. Together, CLL and EG-1 cover 5/6 of all possible bottom-layer states, meaning you will only need EG-2 in 1 out of every 6 solves. Many competitive 2x2 solvers learn CLL + EG-1 first and use a fallback approach for the rare diagonal swap cases while they work on learning EG-2."

There are 29 cases, each solving the diagonal bottom swap and all four top corners simultaneously.\n\nEG-2 is typically the last set learned in the EG family because of its low frequency. From a pure time-saving perspective, CLL and EG-1 together cover 5/6 of solves, so EG-2 only affects roughly 1 in 6 solves. However, for competitive 2x2 solvers aiming for sub-3 or sub-2 averages, having a fast one-look solution for every possible state is essential — falling back to a two-step approach for diagonal swaps costs valuable time in a puzzle where every fraction of a second matters.\n\nWith CLL, EG-1, and EG-2 fully learned, you have complete coverage of all possible 2x2 states after solving one face. This means the entire solve becomes just two steps: solve a face (typically planned in inspection), then apply one algorithm. This is the foundation of competitive 2x2 solving and is used by virtually all top-level solvers. The total algorithm count across all three sets is about 100, which is very manageable compared to 3x3 algorithm sets."

Unlike the beginner method which requires solving a full first layer with correct corner positions, Ortega only needs the face colors to match — the corners can be in any order.\n\nThere are only 6 PBL cases: no swap needed (skip), adjacent swap on top only, adjacent swap on bottom only, adjacent swap on both layers, diagonal swap on one layer, and diagonal swap on both layers. Two of these algorithms (similar to J Perm and Y Perm) may already be familiar from 3x3 solving, which means most cubers can learn the full PBL set in a single practice session.\n\nPBL and the Ortega method are the recommended first step up from the beginner 2x2 method. With just 6 short algorithms, Ortega provides a significant speed improvement over layer-by-layer approaches because you never waste time positioning first-layer corners. Most cubers can achieve sub-5 averages with Ortega before moving on to the more algorithm-heavy CLL and EG methods."

PLL parity happens roughly every other solve (approximately 50% probability), so learning to handle it efficiently is essential for competitive 4x4 times. Note that PLL parity is separate from OLL parity, which is a different issue that affects edge orientation.\n\nThis set contains approximately 22 algorithms that combine standard PLL patterns with parity corrections, allowing you to fix parity and permute the last layer simultaneously in a single step. Without these combined algorithms, you would need to first execute a long parity algorithm and then solve PLL separately — adding significant time to your solve. The integrated approach saves 2-4 seconds compared to the two-step method.\n\nThe algorithms tend to be longer than standard 3x3 PLL algorithms due to the parity correction component, and they often involve wide moves (Rw, Uw) that affect the inner layers. Practice these algorithms slowly at first, focusing on accuracy over speed, since a single misaligned inner layer can require you to redo significant portions of the solve. Most competitive 4x4 solvers prioritize learning the parity versions of the most common PLL cases first (U perms, T perm, etc.) and gradually expand their repertoire."

The LBL approach has two main steps: solve the first layer (three edges and the bottom tip), then solve the last layer. This final step is also known as L3E (Last 3 Edges) in the Pyraminx community, since the tips can be trivially aligned at the end.\n\nThere are only 5 cases for the last layer, making this one of the simplest algorithm sets in all of cubing. The cases cover the different ways three edges can be misoriented or mispermuted. Most algorithms are short (4-8 moves) and easy to fingertrick. A complete beginner can learn all 5 cases in a single sitting, and the recognition is straightforward since there are so few possibilities.\n\nLBL with these 5 algorithms is the standard beginner method for Pyraminx and can achieve times in the 8-15 second range with practice. For cubers wanting to go faster, L4E is the natural next step — it changes the first step to creating a V-shape instead of a full layer, which is less restrictive and enables faster solutions."

There are 12 cases for the second step, covering all possible arrangements of the four unsolved edges.\n\nThe key advantage of L4E over LBL is that forming a V-shape is significantly less restrictive than solving a complete first layer. When you only need two bottom edges correct instead of three, you have more freedom in how you build the V — this means fewer moves, less searching for pieces, and faster first-step execution. The trade-off is that the second step has more cases (12 vs. 5) and some algorithms are slightly longer, but the net result is faster solves.\n\nL4E is the method used by most competitive Pyraminx solvers achieving sub-5 averages. Combined with good tip alignment (which can be planned during inspection) and efficient V-building, L4E enables times that are significantly faster than what LBL can achieve. The 12 algorithms are manageable to learn in a few practice sessions, making L4E an excellent investment for any Pyraminx solver looking to move beyond the beginner method."

The method has three distinct steps: solve one face, solve the opposite face, and then solve the remaining centers.\n\nThe second step — solving the opposite face — is where the algorithm knowledge comes in. The cases are solved using combinations of two fundamental move sequences: the sledgehammer (R' F R F') and the hedgeslammer (F R' F' R). These two triggers are the building blocks of virtually all skewb algorithms, so mastering them with fast fingertricks pays dividends across all skewb methods. The 10 cases cover every possible state of the opposite face given a solved first face.\n\nSarah's Intermediate is the recommended method for cubers who want to be competitive at skewb without investing in a large algorithm set. It can achieve sub-6 averages with good recognition and fingertricks, which is fast enough for most cubers. For those wanting to push further into sub-4 or sub-3 territory, Sarah's Advanced reduces the solve to just two steps but requires learning 134 cases — a much larger commitment."

Most solutions are built from combinations of sledgehammers (R' F R F') and hedgeslammers (F R' F' R), which means the algorithms share common finger patterns and feel similar once you have drilled the fundamental triggers. Recognition is based on the positions and orientations of the unsolved corners and centers relative to the solved face.\n\nSarah's Advanced is necessary for achieving sub-3 averages and is used by virtually all podium-level skewb competitors. The 134 algorithms may seem daunting, but the shared structure of sledgehammer/hedgeslammer combinations makes them easier to learn than 134 completely unrelated algorithms would be. A good strategy is to learn the cases grouped by first-face color, starting with the most common configurations. Combined with full first-face planning during the 15-second inspection period, this method enables one-look solves that can be executed in under 2 seconds."

The objective is to transform the puzzle from its scrambled, non-cubic shape back into a proper cube form. Until the puzzle is in cube shape, you cannot apply standard algorithms for corner and edge permutation since the layers do not turn in predictable ways.\n\nThe cases are organized by shape groups based on the geometric forms the top and bottom layers create — names like kite, scallop, square, barrel, shield, and mushroom describe the silhouette of each layer. There are approximately 90 distinct shape combinations, but many share the same algorithm or algorithm group, so the actual number of solutions you need to learn is much smaller. Most cubers learn cube shape by grouping cases: first identify the top and bottom shapes, then apply the known sequence to reach cube form.\n\nCube shape is widely considered the most challenging step for Square-1 beginners because the puzzle does not behave like a standard twisty puzzle in its non-cubic state. However, with practice, recognition becomes fast and many shapes can be solved in just 2-4 slice moves. Advanced solvers plan cube shape partially or fully during inspection, and some also use CSP (Cubeshape Parity) techniques to detect and fix parity during this step rather than dealing with it later."

The combination of the top and bottom states determines which CP algorithm to use. The algorithms are short and efficient, making CP one of the faster steps in a Square-1 solve.\n\nCP is a critical step because it determines how the rest of the solve flows. Getting clean, fast CP execution with instant recognition of the 6 cases is essential for competitive Square-1 times. Many solvers practice CP recognition by drilling it as an isolated step until they can identify any case within a fraction of a second."

Parity on the Square-1 is a unique issue — roughly half of all scrambles have odd parity, which means a standard solve sequence will leave you one swap away from solved at the end. CSP fixes this upfront by incorporating a parity correction into the cubeshape algorithms.\n\nThe key advantage of CSP is that parity detection can happen during the 15-second inspection period, which does not count toward your solve time. By examining the positions of specific pieces during inspection, you can determine whether the scramble has odd or even parity. If odd parity is detected, you use a different cubeshape algorithm that simultaneously restores the cube shape and fixes parity. This eliminates the need for a separate, time-consuming parity algorithm later in the solve.\n\nCSP is considered an advanced technique because it requires the ability to detect parity quickly during inspection and to know alternate cubeshape solutions for parity cases. However, for competitive Square-1 solvers, the time saved is substantial — parity algorithms applied later in the solve typically cost 2-4 seconds, and eliminating them makes a significant difference in averages. Most top Square-1 solvers use CSP or a similar parity-during-cubeshape approach."

Each case is defined by how many and which edges are misoriented. The algorithms are relatively short and use slice moves (the / notation unique to Square-1) to flip edge orientations without disturbing the already-solved corners. Recognition is straightforward since you are simply looking at the top and bottom faces for edges whose colors do not match.\n\nEO is a quick step in most solves but accurate recognition is important — misidentifying an EO case leads to incorrect edge orientations that compound problems in later steps. Practice recognizing which edges are flipped quickly, and drill the 5 algorithms until they are automatic."

There are 4 basic EP cases in the standard (non-parity) state.\n\nWhen parity is present (if it was not fixed during cubeshape using CSP), additional EP parity variants exist that require modified algorithms. These parity EP cases effectively double the case count, which is why many competitive solvers prefer to handle parity earlier via CSP rather than dealing with it during EP. The parity versions of EP algorithms are typically longer and less ergonomic.\n\nEP recognition involves identifying which edges need to swap on the top and bottom layers — similar to PLL recognition on a 3x3 but with the unique Square-1 notation. Clean, fast EP execution is the final piece of a competitive Square-1 solve, and since it is the last step, there is no recovery from mistakes.

There are approximately 17 cases to learn.\n\nThe trade-off is clear: more algorithms in exchange for fewer steps. The 17 OBL cases cover every combination of CO and EO states, and many of the algorithms are longer than their individual CO or EO counterparts since they handle both orientations at once. Recognition also requires evaluating both corner and edge orientations simultaneously, which takes practice to do quickly.\n\nOBL is recommended for Square-1 solvers who have already mastered the standard step-by-step approach and are looking for the next level of optimization. The time savings come not just from the shorter algorithm sequence but also from eliminating the pause between CO and EO recognition. For competitive solvers aiming for sub-10 averages, OBL is one of several advanced techniques that contribute to shaving off those critical seconds."
