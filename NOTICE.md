# NOTICE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This project, **zkt-timer**, is a derivative work developed by **ibrhyyme**. It is built upon the foundation of several open-source projects and utilizes various libraries to provide a comprehensive cubing experience. 

We deeply acknowledge and respect the efforts of the original authors and the open-source community. This file lists the projects that served as a base, inspiration, or were directly integrated into **zkt-timer**.

## Core Foundation & Architecture

The core architecture of this project is based on the **cubedesk** project. We are grateful to the original author for laying the groundwork that made **zkt-timer** possible.

*   **Original Project Architecture:** Derived from **cubedesk** by **kash**.

## Features & Inspirations

Several key features of **zkt-timer** were inspired by, adapted from, or implemented after studying the following open-source projects. We thank these developers for their contributions to the speedcubing community:

*   **Multiplayer System (Friendly Competition):** The logic for the "LetsCube" friendly competition mode was inspired by the work of **coder13**.
*   **Scramble Generation & Analysis:** The 2x2 subset scramble generation and the multi-phase analysis features were implemented by studying the open-source code of **cstimer** and **min2phase**, developed by **cs0x7f**.
*   **Algorithm Tutorials:** The algorithm learning modules and smart cube support for tutorials are based on concepts and code from **cubedex** by **poliva**.
*   **Smart Cube & Bluetooth Integration:** The Bluetooth connection handling and gyroscope/movement logic for smart cubes were supported by the examples and libraries provided in **gan-web-bluetooth** by **afedotov**.

## Third-Party Libraries
